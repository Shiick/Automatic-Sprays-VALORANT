AUTOMATIC SPRAYS VALORANT

This script simply exports all the sprays inside VALORANT.

Note that animated sprays aren't taken into account. Exported normally.
Will only look like a flipbook, your job to make them into a gif.

Simply valorant_path to your own installation to the VALORANT paks.
And don't forget to change repo_path to where you have the repository located.

NOTE: This isn't meant to be great, there might be better ways to do this.
Feel free to fork it and apply better changes, I'll merge then.

This relies on UModel.
